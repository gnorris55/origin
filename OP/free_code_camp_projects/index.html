    <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p id="tribute-info">Zeno of Citium, the father of stoicism, was a philosopher during roman times. He was born Citium in 335 B.C. and died 263 B.C. in Athens. Zeno created the school of stoisism on the bases of logic and the avoidence of human suffering. He divided philosphy into three parts: logic, ethics, and physics. stoicism was built off co-existing with nature and noticing that many external events are out of your control. this way of thinking sprouted the idea of taking control of situations that are in your grasp and not worrying about things that you cannot control.
